Components:
1. Data Capture Engine
   Role: Continuously ingests raw data from sensors and IoT devices placed in parking facilities.
   Functions: Data filtering, preprocessing, and forwarding the cleansed data to the central data store.

2. Central Data Store:
   Role: Serves as the central repository for both real-time and historical parking data.
   Usage: Provides a unified source of data for further processing by downstream engines.

3. Analytics & Prediction Engine
   Role: Processes the collected data to analyze current occupancy, detect trends, and forecast future parking availability using machine learning or statistical models.

4. Parking Recommendation Engine:
   Role: Combines real-time data and predictive analytics to offer personalized parking suggestions.
   Usage: Considers factors like predicted occupancy, user preferences, and current availability to recommend the best parking spots.

5. User Interface Layer:
   Role: Delivers actionable insights to end users (drivers, parking administrators) through mobile apps, web portals, or digital signage.
   Features: Real-time parking availability maps, navigation to recommended spots, and other interactive elements.
